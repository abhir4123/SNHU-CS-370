# SNHU-CS-370

This project involved building an intelligent agent for a treasure hunt game where a pirate (NPC) needed to find the treasure before the human player. The pirate agent used deep Q-learning to learn the best path through the maze. For this project, I was given the starter code that included the environment setup, helper classes (TreasureMaze and GameExperience), and the basic Jupyter Notebook structure. I created the deep Q-learning training algorithm (qtrain) myself. This included implementing the exploration vs. exploitation logic, experience replay memory, batch training, model updating, and adjusting the epsilon value based on performance. I also configured the training process to update the neural network after each move to improve stability and learning efficiency. All edits and development were completed inside the provided Jupyter Notebook.

Computer scientists design, build, and analyze systems that solve complex problems across different areas like gaming, finance, healthcare, security, and more. Their work matters because technology shapes how people live, work, and interact. In fields like artificial intelligence, computer scientists create systems that can learn, adapt, and make decisions, which has a massive impact on innovation and society. As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable pieces. I first define the problem clearly, understand the requirements, then design algorithms and solutions that can solve it. I test, debug, and improve based on feedback and results. This course especially taught me that iteration and experimentation (like tweaking epsilon values or batch sizes) are key parts of finding better solutions. As a developer, I have an ethical responsibility to prioritize user safety, privacy, fairness, and transparency. The systems I create must be secure, avoid bias, and be understandable to users. I also owe it to the organization to create reliable, maintainable, and responsible code that protects both the business and the people it serves. AI systems especially must be built and monitored carefully to avoid unintended harm.
